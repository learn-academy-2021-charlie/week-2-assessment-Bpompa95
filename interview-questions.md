# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer:From what i learn for iteration, Iteration means that it performs a particular action number of times over and over until the condition is met.

  Researched answer:In JavaScript an iterator is an object which defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its termination. Specifically, an iterator is any object which implements the Iterator protocol by having a next() method that returns an object with two properties: value. The next value in the iteration sequence. done



2. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer:From what i learn in class map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element or value. javascript has many built-in method in the parameter it can use length, toUppercase, slice, indexOf, chartAt, includes and toLowerCase.

  Researched answer:map() is a built-in function that allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable without using an explicit for loop, a technique commonly known as mapping. map() is useful when you need to apply a transformation function to each item in an iterable



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:Destructuring is a convenient way of creating new variables by extracting some values from data stored in objects or arrays. To name a few use cases, destructuring can be used to destructure function parameters

  Researched answer:The object destructuring is a useful JavaScript feature to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables. What's better, object destructuring can extract multiple properties in one statement, can access properties from nested objects, and can set a default value if the property doesn't exist.



4. What is the difference between an object and a class?

  Your answer:From what i know the difference between a class and object, a class is more like a craete an object for example, class is more like a blue print you are getting the idea to make it look alive. And objects are a datatype that contain collections of key value pairs
 objects are the cross section of data (static information) and behavior (methods)

  Researched answer:The difference is simple and conceptual. ... A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.



5. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer:in the constructor method aka class inheritance we call super() which passes the attributes from the constructor in the parent class. From what i remember in class we call it the chilld that's how i remember we have to use it after we extend.

  Researched answer:The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects. It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor. The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses and subclasses that have methods with the same name



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: From what i remember in class it is javascript it blocks out actions of defining all the declarations at the top of the scope before you code execution weather if the scop global or local.

  Researched answer:Hoisting is JS's default behavior of defining all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution. One of the benefits of hoisting is that it enables us to call functions before they appear in the code. JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. React: React is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

2. React lifecycle methods: What are React lifecycle methods? You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death. Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events. I like to think of them as going through a cycle of birth, growth, and death.

3. React state: The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

4. Component invocation/call:The procedural code in a method is executed by invoking the method with an INVOKE statement, an inline method invocation or. referencing a verb-signature, or. referencing an object property.

5. DOM Events: HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document. Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will not be executed before the event occurs (such as when a user clicks a button).
